
Baraja
=========

Baraja is a jQuery plugin that allows to move elements in a card-like fashion and spread them like one would spread a deck of cards on a table. It uses CSS transforms for rotating and translating the items. There are several options available that will create various spreading possibilities of the items, for example, moving the items laterally or rotating them in a fan-like way.
